This projects implements a robotic control strategy and complementary neuro-based controller, that can be applied to robotic systems to automatically extract the eigenfrequency of a mechanical system and drive the system along this mode in an energy efficient manner. 

This repository is divided into 3 parts: 
1) two template projects to run in the NRP incorporating 
   - a model of the 2-joint myoarm driven by a robotic controller
   - a model of a simple 2-joint hopper driven by a spinal chord modal

2) A Technical Documentation giving details about the theoretical background of the applied controllers

3) A User Documentation explaining how to use the template experiments in the NRP
   A short How-To explanation can also be found in the ReadMe of each of the template projects.
